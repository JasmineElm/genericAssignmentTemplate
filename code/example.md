## Introduction {-}

Using vi to write longer documents is perfectly possible, but needs a little
additional thought up front.
[grok-ing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim)
vi not only allows you to move around efficiently, but also effectively edit and
restructure text.  

_Fluently speaking vi_ allows you leverage the huge amount of power in vanilla
`vi`. Instead of installing hundreds of plugins, minimal configuration can
provide the same functionality without sacrificing speed or compatibility. For
instance a reasonable analogue `goyo` might be achieved by removing the ruler
and line numers. Does this look as pretty as the `goyo` results? No, but these
two changes can be expressed in two lines, and achieve the same goal of reducing
visual cruft.  Plugins are a personal choice however.  There are some that I simply wouldn't be without.  For instance the combination of `vim-pandoc` and `vim-pandoc-syntax` are hard to beat.  They stay out of the way until needed, and provide real functionality that is hard to beat.  Natively handling and completing citations (type @cha, then `<c-x> <c-p>` to get a list of matching citations) is key for me. Arguably VSCode does this better with simple tab completion, but the extra keypress is easily outweighed by vi loading near enough instantly as oposed to the five to ten seconds that it takes VSCode and plugins to start.   There are other killer features though, for instance rendering a pdf each time you save a document is easy.
This repo has its' own `build` script that can be used:

```vim 
if empty(glob('./build')) 
  let g:pandoc#command#autoexec_command   = "Pandoc! pdf"
else 
  let g:pandoc#command#autoexec_command   = ":silent !./build silent" 
  endif
```

Another plugin recommendation is `vim-lexical` this is another plugin that stays out of the way, but this time it simply corrects commonly mispelt words such as 'teh'.  

## Why use a text editor over Word {-}

Word is a great tool.  hether you want to write a letter, do a mail merge, create some kind of word art monstrosity or anything in between, word has a wide range of functionality.  The majority of this functionality is very much in your face however.  Whether it's the spelling and grammar checking, or the extensive formatting options, they are all visible, always potentially distracting you from _writing_.  In contrast, with `vi`, you are explicitly either writing or editing text.  The visual distractions are minimal, and can be reduced even further through pretty minimal configuration.  The editing in vi feels more precise too; cutting and pasting a sentence can be done with `(d)` then `p` rather than pfaffing around with a mouse, or `Ctrl+Shift` key combinations.

## Using Markdown {-}

Using a lightweight markup language such as `markdown` means formatting is a trivial case of adding the relevant mars such as \_\_ for italics, or \#\# for a second level heading.  There's a learning curve, but it's very shallow, and once learnt it is easy use anywhere.  Markdown helps further abstract _writing_ and  _editing_ and _formatting_.  Formatting is important, but it's typically something you'd want to consider _after you've written_ rather than during the wrinting process.  A second benefit to markdown is that it is easy to read, edit, and store.  There is no complex file type here, it's puerly a text file with a `.md` extension.


Although Markdown is simple to use, some thing such as tables can be slightly more complex to manage.  The below table looks like this:

```text
| Don't | Open   |
|-------|--------|
|  Dead | Inside |
```
in the source file.  Pipes and hyphens are used to build the table.  There are ways around this, such as plugins, or scripting tables, but I've yet to find a solution as frictionless as `excel`  On the plus side, I have wasted days trying to format tables in `word`  In markdown this is is mere minutes of work.  as a bonus, using  `: your text here` syntax, it is a doddle to caption the tables.  Using pandoc, this syntax filters through to base `LaTeX` syntax, meaning it'll appear if you use the `lot` tag in YAML.

| Don't | Open   |
|-------|--------|
|  Dead | Inside |

: Here is a figure for the table


Code blocks are something i've never seen done well in Word. In basic markdown stylesheets, they look OK, but applying standard filters in pandoc, they look great; syntax highlighting is good, and the resulting code blocks look, well, like _code_  for instance a for loop in bash:

```BASH 
for i in {0..9}
  do echo $i
done 
```
The same loop in Python

```python
for i in range(0,9):
    print($i)
```

Not a for loop, not a programming language, but still presented correctly...

```sql 
select sysdate from dual
```

### Handling lists in Markdown   {-}

Vanilla markdown makes handling lists easy.  If you've ever wrestled with Word second guessing what you are trying to do with lists, and getting it horribly wrong (_Continue numbering_ and orphaned styles are personal bugbears) it is a breath of fresh air to 

```text
+ represent
+ bulletpoints
  + like 
  + this
```

which renders as you'd expect:

+ represent
+ bulletpoints
  + like 
  + this

Numbered lists are more complex, but follow the same understandable rules around indentation with the bonus of not needing to remeber what number you are on: 

```text
1. numbered 
1. lists 
1. for the win
```


1. numbered 
1. lists 
1. for the win

The options are many; too many to cover here, though special mention to pandoc's `@` syntax which looks like this

```text
@) numbered 
@) lists 

split by text

@) work with special syntax
```


@) numbered 
@) lists 

split by text

@) work with special syntax

Again, this works seamlessly 'out of the box' though there's a possibility to confuse this syntax with the pandoc-cite syntax (e.g.  @chatfieldchatfield_how_2012 )

+ how about a test of vim-pandoc's hard, automatic wrapping option (`hA`) this should kick in at column 79
+ fingers crossed it does..! 
+ success..!

 @chatfieldchatfield_how_2012

_some useful tests / syntax..._

_italic_

__bold__

[small caps]{.smallcaps} aren't supported in vanilla markdown, but are in
pandoc...
